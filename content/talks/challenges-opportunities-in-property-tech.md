A few weeks ago, I was invited to be a guest on a high profile fintech podcast called Hitechies. It was fantastic to speak with the host, Pramod Dhakal, who is based in Belgium.

We talked casually how I started in fintech with Camino Financial, then how I transitioned to proptech in the midst of the pandemic. I touched on how blockchain is revolutionizing the real estate space and my outlook on the future of crypto, online lending and fintech in general.
