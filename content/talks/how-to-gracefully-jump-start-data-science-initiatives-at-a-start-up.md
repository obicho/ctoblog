#### About the Talk
While machine learning and artificial intelligence can deliver a ton of value to businesses, there are still many businesses today struggling to get started with data science initiatives. Do you buy data or collect data? What type of talent to hire to get started on the first project? What kind of data tool chain, data infrastructure and data lake make most sense to set up in the beginning? These questions can be challenging, especially for companies that are still in early stages. Missteps could cost companies missed opportunities, wasted time and even the company itself! The talk discusses various best practices on the management, planning and execution of data science projects in a resource-constrained start-up environment. It will also cover common pitfalls and gotchas to watch out for. The presentation will benefit the following audience: new data science managers, start-up founders, data scientist looking to become managers and C-level executives.
