#### About the Talk
Every great career begins with a dream. However, that alone is often not enough. A dreamer must be given the opportunity to try, to fail and to succeed. In 1999, I was fortunate enough to go to Tokyo for a summer internship. Thatâ€™s where I met Joi Ito, got exposed to open source software for the first time and much more. It was a life-changing experience and even today I continue to cherish it. Fast forward to today, I started an internship program at a Fintech company and am having some success in building a stellar team of misfits while offering a similar life-changing experience.
