#### About the Talk
For a startup founder in the impact space, it is not that difficult to just build a company. There are so many technology tools that can help a startup in the initiation phase. It almost cost just a fraction of what it used to be 10 years ago, both in terms of time and resources, to bring a product to market for validation. However, it is challenging to build a GREAT company that can make a dent in this entropic universe we live in. There are so many reasons, some less obvious than others, that can completely derail your smooth-sailing, eco-loving, people-enabling startup. 

This talk will pull back the curtain for startup founders and early teams. It will also highlight some common misconceptions that can prevent a company from being great.
