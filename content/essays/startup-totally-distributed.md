Lately I noticed many startups operate in a totally distributed fashion. They don’t have an office. Founders / founding team live in different city / state / country. Their funding comes from VCs and angel investors in different city / state / country. They are on Zoom a lot. They meet once a quarter or year for a team building event. When possible, they outsource non-core competencies to a third party.

However, they all have a physical address or a PO box. That’s their last tether to the old world.

Is it possible to remove that tether? Not even a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) can remove that tether. Would be interesting to see how this develops.
