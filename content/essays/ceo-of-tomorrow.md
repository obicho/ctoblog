What percentage of Y Combinator founders are technical?

Nobody really keeps track of this data. I looked. However, based on my research, it seems that typically at least one co-founder is more on the technical side within a startup. Anecdotally, I happen to know quite a few co-founders who are engineers by training and got funding from Mucker Capital.

As more businesses become accessible online, it is almost impossible to ignore the fact that a person with a technical background is better suited to run a company.

Why? Because, as a business executive, one needs to have enough knowledge about running business online in order to execute effectively.

For example:

* What kind of technical infrastructure do we need in order to provide a service or support the sale of a product at early stage, middle stage and late stage?
* How do we find my customers online through growth hacking?
* How to set up data analytics properly so that we can continuously monitor our sales funnel and performance of our staff?
* How do we defy online hacking into our systems?
* How to eliminate manual processing time through automation? Imagine if we can save 5 minutes per day per person in a 30-person company, we save 27 days in a year. That gives us 13 months to operate in a fiscal year.

Imagine a CEO without any intuition about the answers to these questions, it is going to be hard to run a company. Sure, you can fill your C-suite with people that know. However, it is costly and time-consuming to get quality answers.
