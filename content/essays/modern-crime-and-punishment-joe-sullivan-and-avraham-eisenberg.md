> Former Chief Security Officer Of Uber Convicted Of Federal Charges For Covering Up Data Breach Involving Millions Of Uber User Records

News Headline #2: Oct 15th 2022

> Hacker behind the Mango Markets exploit keeps $47M and returns $67M to the DeFi platform after a Mango community vote; he claims his actions were legal  

A high profile CISO, Sullivan, tried to do his job but ended up getting convicted in federal court. But, we had a hacker, Eisenberg, who manipulated shady trading strategies and ended up walking away with $47M – legally.

I am not saying who is right and who is wrong here. I am wondering if they each have a moral compass and is our judicial system so broken that it cannot be fixed.
