Before the pandemic, shopping for groceries used to be a giant production for my family. Every weekend, we would set aside a few hours, load our kids into our car, bring our shopping bags, pick some groceries at a local supermarket, bag everything, drive home, unload everything from the car, etc. And, repeat all over the following weekend. _Argh!_

Then, came the pandemic, and everything changed!

Instacart and other grocery shopping startups really started to enjoy a boom because nobody was going out. Many supermarkets started grocery delivery services too on their own. Ethnic food delivery startup, Weee!, raised some $400 million at $4 billion valuation in early 2022. Christmas came early for grocery delivery tech startups.

Just as I thought these companies were going to upend traditional supermarkets forever, the roof came crashing down for these grocery delivery startups. As the country emerged from lockdowns, people obviously have more options where to get their food.

But I think there is something else going on here. For one, I don’t miss going to grocery stores every weekend so I am unlikely to return to that routine. It is a hassle and a big time waster. 

One interesting trend that I have been observing is that more people are now buying food on Facebook and instant messaging chat apps like LINE, WeChat and WhatsApp. I have discovered very authentic, ethnic food prepared by someone’s mother-in-law (even father-in-law) in my neighborhood. For example, I can procure famous Sichuan spicy duck tongue and Taiwanese stinky tofu (very, very stinky) and get them delivered right to my door. For those that don’t know what they are, here are some descriptions.

> Duck Tongues have a gelatinous yet slightly crunchy texture, and are most attractive to the Chinese palate. These tiny things, which do not feature in other cuisines, grace many a regional table in China.

> Often referred to as the national snack food of Taiwan, stinky tofu gives off a putrid odor that’s so intense, it engulfs its surroundings in a foul-smelling funk that’s reminiscent of sour milk and rotting garbage. Love it or loathe it, these spiced and sliced fermented slabs pack a uniquely spoiled taste that’s all their own.

These foods are so authentic that it wouldn’t have been possible to get them 10 years ago unless you visit China and Taiwan, respectively. The restaurant version here just doesn't cut it.

These days, I can also order other kinds of groceries and dinner plates more catered to our taste, from food sellers working out of their garages, home kitchens or ADUs. The food almost look like something my grandma would make -- so nostalgic.

For the time being, we are still getting groceries delivered. One thing’s for sure, our weekend meals now include more variety. And, I am truly happy that I no longer have to go to a supermarket.
