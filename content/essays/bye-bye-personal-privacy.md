It is hard to stop devices tracking humans. Devices are everywhere, whether you want it or not.

If you use a phone, you are going to get tracked.

If you use Alexa, you are going to get tracked.

If you use a Chromecast or Amazon fire TV stick, you are going to get tracked.

If you have IoT devices, you are going to get tracked.

If you live in a smart city with a ton of surveillance cameras, like London or Paris, you are going to get tracked.

If you use an Apple watch or fitness tracker, you are going to get tracked.

If you use a Ring, you are going to get tracked.

If you use a Metromile (pay car insurance by the mile), you are going to get tracked.

If you bought some bitcoins, you are going to get tracked.

The list goes on.

The only way to evade tracking is to cover your face, go off grid and transact in cash.
