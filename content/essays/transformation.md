_A message sent through Slack to the team announcing an internship graduation_.

---
A long long time ago, there was a boy who wasn’t fortunate in his career. After graduating from college, he had been in transition a few times, working on stuff that was neither meaningful nor rewarding.

One day, he came across a job posting at Camino for an internship opportunity. In winter, we interviewed him but we didn’t bring him onboard. Camino was going through some rough moments itself and his interview was lackluster one.

By summer, things came around a bit for Camino and we needed the position filled. He was invited for another round of interview and we decided to take him onboard.

It wasn’t easy in the beginning. He had to learn and do many things quickly while taking on occasional wrath from his boss. Whenever he got a bit better, more tasks and responsibilities would ensued. Never got too many chances to rest on his laurels. Standards just kept getting higher and higher.

But, he kept going and going. Perseverance was his thing. If he didn’t do well the first time, he would keep trying until it’s on par with the standards upheld by his team.

Fast forward 15 months, this boy is no longer recognizable, for he has become a man bursting with RARE qualities…

This man is none other than [CENSORED] whose impact can be felt organization-wide on a daily basis in both [CENSORED] and [CENSORED]. This month his internship will be ending because he has been graduated to a full-time staff status at Camino. Please put your hands together in congratulating our friend and associate, [CENSORED].
Welcome to the family, @[CENSORED]
