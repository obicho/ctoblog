Lately, I have been watching Michelin star sushi chefs on Youtube preparing fish for serving _omakase_ behind a sushi bar. If you're looking for a more traditional sushi restaurant experience, _omakase_ is the way to go. You'll be seated at the sushi bar in front of the chef, so you can easily chat and watch as your meal is made. The chef will also likely share stories and insights about their career, adding to the overall atmosphere.

It dawned on me that a 10x software engineer is not too different from a Michelin star sushi chef.

A 10x software engineer would make sure that the coding environment is optimized so that best code can be written efficiently. This means the linting is there, debugger is available, etc. This is akin to a sushi chef sharping the knives to be used at a sushi bar.

A 10x software engineer would love showing off his or her code through a pull request and welcome feedback. This is akin to a sushi chef making sushi for customers and watching them eat with pleasure.

A 10x software engineer would be open to sharing his technical knowledge with his or her peers. This is akin to a sushi chef sharing his or her stories about their career with their customers at the sushi bar.

Having _omakase_ is an art form. So is witnessing beautiful code automate away manual tasks flawlessly.
