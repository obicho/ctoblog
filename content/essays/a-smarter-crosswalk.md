Crosswalks have been around a long time but they don’t ever change. I closely observed one today. There is a sign that says ‘Push button for Pedestrian Crossing’. And then, there is a countdown signal forever pestering people to walk faster.

I think this is very dated. With Tesla able to autopilot itself today, I am sure the technology exists for sensors and cameras to detect the presence of pedestrians.

How about we innovate this thing inside out? Instead of needing to press a button, let’s use a sensor to activate traffic lights. This will be particularly helpful for those that cannot see or on a wheelchair. Sometimes, parents walking with children could potentially take longer to cross therefore the countdown timer should be able to accommodate for those scenarios. There should also be warning signs beaming at cars that are going too fast.

Why not?
