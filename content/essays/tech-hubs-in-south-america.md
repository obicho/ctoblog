Over the last decade, South America has been a popular place to recruit technology talents. I really enjoy working with technology teams from the region. Its close proximity to US, time zone overlap and a large talent pool are the main reasons why it has worked for me.

Here are my favorite places:

### Mexico’s Guadalajara
Guadalajara is a gem of the Latin American software industry and has become a cutting-edge city with a robust tech ecosystem. The state of Jalisco holds 40% of the IT industry in Mexico and 650 specialized companies providing 100,000 jobs to residents of the area. 

### Costa Rica’s San José
San José is home to well over 800 technology companies on its own, both local and global. Notable companies include:  Amazon, IBM, Intel Corporation, DXC Technology, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard Enterprise | HPE, Concentrix.

### Brazil’s São Paulo
With over 36 million inhabitants in its extended urban area, São Paulo is not just Brazil’s most populous city, it’s one of the largest in the world. This sprawling metropolis is the financial heart of the country. It has also become one of the world’s most exciting tech hubs.

### Argentina’s Buenos Aires
In Buenos Aires, a few tech giants have thrived to continually add relevance to the life of both its 15M citizens and the global tech market. Buenos Aires is home for over 85% of the tech hub community in the country. As a leading region among the net exporter of developers, Buenos Aires prides itself with a befitting track record in its advanced tech operations.

### Colombia’s Medellin
Medellin boasts more than 40,000 people who meet in groups centered around topics such as AI, IoT and blockchain. The World Economic Forum has recognized Medellin’s progress. And hundreds of tech and global companies have opened offices there.
