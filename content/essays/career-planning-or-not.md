The amazing thing about meeting people in tech is that you can put people in two camps. The first camp is the founder type: they have a strong vision and want to build something to change the world. You can feel the energy blasting from every cell when they speak.

People in the second camp are professionals. They work for wonderful corporations and they are masters in what they do. Every step of the way, they work hard to build their career. They are proud of their accomplishments and capabilities. They get paid well doing it.

People in the 1st camp sometimes complained: did I spend too much time on my business that I am forgetting everything else? Like family and personal hobby?

People in the 2nd camp sometimes whined: Life catches up with me. Why didn’t I pursue that billion dollar idea that I had from the other night?

The take away is that people should learn how to change camps when they realize that they no longer belong. No one will judge you.

That’s key to happiness.
