Being a real estate agent has always been a good option for people who want to generate income while maintaining a flexible schedule. Often, they only work on weekends to show houses and then at night, after kids go to sleep, they write up the contracts. During the week, they socialize and meet people physically. They too invest time on digital campaigns over emails and social media to bring about awareness. Robert Reffkin, the founder and CEO of Compass, started his company precisely because of his mom who single-handedly raised him while she made a living as a real estate agent. Many neighborhood moms (and dads) who like this setup do the same today.

In my mind, being an agent is sustainable entrepreneurship. Agents are not looking for that 30x return from going to IPO. Agents are after the commission money, which is realistic and practical. The best part – there is time to focus on something else – such as family – so that you are spreading your risk and living a balanced lifestyle.
